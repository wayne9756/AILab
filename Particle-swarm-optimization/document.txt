article:Solution of ackley function based on particle swarm optimization algorithm//
site: https://ieeexplore.org/document/9213634 

each particles has their own position and velocity in every dimension;

so that the varible of ackley is a particle instead of a swarm.

the summation of x means that the sum of every dimension not the sum of every particles

so I need to revised the compostion of particles which position and velocity are vectors
